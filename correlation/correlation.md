Correlation analysis is common practice when attempting to understand the relationships among variables. There are several statistical measurements that can be performed. And with such an understanding of a relationship, future values may be predicted and decisions taken.

We will cover:

*What is Correlation?*

Correlation or correlation analysis is studying the relationship between two variables. This may involve the calculation of one or a number of statistics:

	* Pearson Product Moment Correlation
	* Spearman's Rank Correlation
	* Mutual Information

The predominant method is Pearsons, who developed this from the original correlation inventor, Francis Galton. It measures (if any) the linear relationship between the two given variables.

This coefficient can range from -1 (negative correlation) to +1 (positive correlation).

	* Positive (+1): increasing one variable gives a proportional INCREASE in the other
	* Negative (-1): increasing one variable gives a proportional DECREASE in the other
	* No correlation (0): an increase in one variable gives no change in the other

*Uses of correlation*

An understanding of a correlation can help investigate dependence and possibly help you make predictions on future values.

It can be used by money managers to identify independent (non-correlated) assets, in order to balance risk in their portfolio. Traditionally these have been real estate, emerging markets and gold or precious metals.

It may help an electric utility investigate the relationship between temperature and building energy usage. Electricity generation may then be ramped up in expectation for colder temperatures.

*A worked example of Correlation*

Bitcoin enthusiasts would claim this digital asset is a non-correlated asset to the market, like Gold, and worth holding as part of a larger portfolio. Although it is a new invention and the historical data is limited, we can began to investigate this... checkout this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HsJanJ4akB8rCp4nliAa4GGlL_yVwBvI).
